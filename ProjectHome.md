A little while ago our project's XML files were out of control and I didn't want to have to open each one in our favorite IDE and use that tool to format them because it was just too time consuming. I began searching for a tool like Jalopy that would format the xml but couldn't find one. Noting that the code is rather easy for just standard XML formatting.  After searching the Internet for 30 minutes with no luck, we decided to write our own tool. The XML formatter has been designed to ingest any xml files to include the project pom.xml files and format them... This is very useful for parent poms to run recursively. By default the XML formatter uses the includes all xml files and an empty exclude pattern. Developer's Note: At the moment this code is setup to only work with Java 1.6 or newer because of the use of transformations (JAXP which was included in Java in version 1.6 not 1.5).
